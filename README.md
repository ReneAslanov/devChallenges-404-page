## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ReneAslanov/devChallenges-404-page/blob/main/project-screenshot.jpg)

You can see a demo of this project [here](https://lucky-kulfi-068964.netlify.app/).
I started this project because I felt like my CSS skills were not as good as they used to be, even though they were never really that good :).

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

I just used vanilla HTML and CSS to build this small project.
